# E-kart

Please follow these steps before running this project.

1.Create EKART db in mongoDB. Go to db folder first and import all collection files(Cart,Users,Products,Wishlist) in mongo db.
2.import ekartservice and ekartui in your workspace.before running check all the dependencies.
3.I have implemented Products,Account,Wishlist module completely and cart module is partially completed.
4.When you run ekartui for the first time, use internet connection so that all boostrap files will get downloaded or you can install bootstrap in your system.
  (without doing this, UI will not function properly)
